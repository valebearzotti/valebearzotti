I build stuff in the web. 
really cool stuff.

I'm a nerd for space, huge music enthusiast and ocasional piano player

I believe:
- good deeds make the difference
- there are no selfless acts
- celebrating someone else's success will never take away anything from your own
- whatever you strive for you can totally get it
- luck (and timing) has a lot to do too
